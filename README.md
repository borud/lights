# ESP8266 based RGBW light controller

This is a work in progress so be forewarned.  

In order to build this you need to
install [Platformio](https://platformio.org/).  

Before building you also need to rename
`src/config_wifi_edit_and_rename.h` to `src/config_wifi.h` and set
your wireless access point parameters.
